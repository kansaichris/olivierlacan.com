A great free app which will allow you to customize a few important parts of your Mac OS X installation like which folder the system should save screenshots and in what format, chose whether or not to display hidden files (useful for developers), etc.

There is a reset button in case you screw up something. If you're an old Windows user like me, think of it as the wonder that was TweakUI many years ago.
