# [Screenflow](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screenflow/id422025166?mt=12) & ["Screeny](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screeny/id440991524?mt=12)
The former is a great app for both recording and editing high quality screencasts with several audio tracks, and transition effects. It puts any video editing tool to shame. The latter is a nifty simple screen recording tool by Drew Wilson to create screencasts in seconds.
