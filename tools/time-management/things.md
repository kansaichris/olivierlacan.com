# [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things/)
The only task management application I've ever truly trusted. I use it on both OS X and iOS. The syncing service makes it easy.

No lie here, I often forget about Things entirely, only to return to a list of tasks I've either completed or forgotten about. That says more about my commitment to Getting Things Done than about the quality of this specific software.
