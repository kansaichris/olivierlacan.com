# [Byword](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id420212497?mt=12) & [iA Writer](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id439623248?mt=12)
Two fantastic focused writing apps. Byword, especially since I'm using it right now, is what [WriteRoom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom) should have become had it embraced Markdown and the evolution of the sector. iA Writer gets a bad wrap for being overly simple, but I love how it displays [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax in a right-aligned gutter.
