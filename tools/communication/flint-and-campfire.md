# [Flint](http://giantcomet.com/flint) and [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/)

A fantastic native [Campfire](http://campfirenow.com) client (no need to leave the browser open anymore), leagues better (and cheaper) than the old Propane. Campfire is the best passive communication tool for teams. In a similar fashion to IRC it allows everyone to join chat rooms, but its superiority comes from the fact that all discussions and files uploaded to the rooms are logged and searchable.

As an ex-IRC power user, I can guarantee you the two don't compare. For one Campfire is a monthly paid service, and Flint itself is a $10 (worth it, support indie developers) expense that only professionals will be able to justify. More importantly, no more worries about server splits (although Campfire isn't perfect), bot attacks on public servers, maintaining your own server, or teaching people how to use IRC commands.

Campfire can display links to images inline which is perfect for posting silly pictures from Reddit, but also to discuss designs and wireframes within a team.

If you allow your team to communicate in a more asynchronous manner, you might be surprised when the amount of trivial emails is reduced and you don't feel like you need meetings to catch up on what everyone is doing.

For that I will refer you to Zach Holman's [tremendous post on working asynchronously](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/).
