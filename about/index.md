title: About
---
I've been a self-taught web designer for over 10 years</span> and I've evolved into a software engineer over the last 4 years. Despite my unescapable Frenchness, my favorite languages are English and [Ruby](http://tryruby.org). I spend most of my time building and maintaining [large](https://codeschool.com) and small Rails applications.

I happily ship remotely on [Code School](http://codeschool.com)'s Internal team although I [used to occasionally stop by the office](/posts/i-am-an-alien/).

I wrote the prose for [Try Git](http://try.github.com), worked on & taught a few great courses like [Testing with RSpec](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec), [Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real), [Try jQuery](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery), and some super sneaky secret internal tools.

I created [Shields](http://shields.io) in January 2013 in a bout of constructive rage against bad open source repository metadata badges. I'm a bit amazed by how shiny that rage diamond turned out to be.

Sporadically, I host the [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com) podcast. Constantly, I [tweet](http://twitter.com/olivierlacan) as I breathe. And regularly, I [share the world as I see it](http://instagram.com/olivierlacan).

## Contact

If you'd like to email me securely you can use my [PGP Key](http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xE493B06DD070AFC8) and I recommend reading my little [GPGTools](tools/security/gpgtools.html) article if you don't know much about secure communication. [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/olivierlacan) is a neat alternative with a much easier learning curve although it may not be as secure.
