I now spend [way too much time at conferences](http://lanyrd.com/profile/olivierlacan/) where I occasionally talk about the scientific method applied to development and how to benefit from the incredible tools created by the open source community.

## [Essential Rails Tool](http://speakerdeck.com/olivierlacan/essential-rails-tools)
Working with Rails often means switching between several Ruby versions back and forth which is made almost seamless by RVM. It also involves several simple command line tools like Pry, Pow, and Bundler and that will make your development life so much easier.

## [Science-based Development](https://speakerdeck.com/olivierlacan/science-based-development)
Development, like science, is a messy endeavor. It's near impossible to control all the variables. Testing code is a noble goal, but it's very easy to test the wrong thing. Many experienced scientists are fooled by their senses and biases. To account for that they crafted and refined a Scientific Method. That method has been stress tested by centuries of experimentation, discovery and peer-review. It probably wouldn't hurt to try to apply it to development and see what it can offer.
