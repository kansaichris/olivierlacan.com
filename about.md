[Code School](http://codeschool.com)'s internal developer team is where I happily ship every day.

I wrote the prose for [Try Git](try.github.com), worked on & taught a few great courses like [Testing with RSpec](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec), [Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real), [Try jQuery](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery), and some super secret internal tools we sneakily use.

These sunny days I spend in the wild forests of feature building, code spelunking, and technical debt hunting for [codeschool.com](http://codeschool.com). 

Sporadically, I host the [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com) podcast, constantly I [tweet](http://twitter.com/olivierlacan) instead of breathing, and regularly I [share the world as I see it](http://instagram.com/olivierlacan),
