## Code School
I work remotely on [Code School](http://codeschool.com)'s Internal 
team. There, I maintain and build features for [codeschool.com](codeschool.com) along with 
other little things that keep me up at night.

In the past I've written and participated in the development
of some of courses.

## Code School Courses
### [Try Git](http://try.github.com)
I wrote the prose for this short course with a lot of 
help from the rest of our team and [Matthew McCullough](https://twitter.com/matthewmccull).

We tried to keep the scope of this project small since most people don't like or
are afraid of using the command line. We reproduced a shell (thanks to 
[Adam Rensel](https://twitter.com/adamrensel)'s hard work) that would 
execute git commands and produce realistic output.

I still remember when we released this on July 4th, 2012 and 
[GitHub announced it on their blog](https://github.com/blog/1183-try-git-in-your-browser).
I had to scale the Heroku dynos for the course from my bed using 
[Nezumi](http://nezumiapp.com/) because I could tell we were starting to 
be slammed with visitors.

### [Testing with RSpec](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)
This was the first Code School course I ever had to teach in front of a 
camera, and that along was more than a little bit stressful. 
Aside from some limited exposure, I learned most of what I know about 
RSpec while working on this course. I also received a lot of useful advice 
from people like [Envy Labs](envylabs.com)' [Nathaniel Bibler](https://twitter.com/nbibler) 
who had written and taught our previous testing course: Rails Testing for Zombies. 

### [Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/testing-with-rspec)
My second Code School course as a teacher. Although I didn't participate 
much in the writting, I spent a lot of time working on the slides with 
Gregg Pollack to make sure we properly presented the concepts of staging, 
remote repositories, branching, and especially rebasing.

The Tron-inspired design and illustrations that Justin Mezzell 
created for this course, aside from being gorgeous, helped quite a bit by 
allowing us to identify some concepts — through iconography for instance.

[Git Real](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real), 
[Try jQuery](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery), 
and some super sneaky secret internal tools.

## Open Source
### [Shields](https://github.com/badges/shields)
I created [Shields](http://shields.io) in January 2013 in a bout of constructive rage against bad open source repository metadata badges. I'm a bit amazed by how shiny that rage diamond turned out to be.

Thanks to the amazing work of the community (I had very little to do 
with it), we now have an [awesome API](http://shields.io/) that can 
[generate Retina-grade SVG badges on the fly](http://img.shields.io/badge/how%20cool-is%20that%3F-yellowgreen.svg).

## Podcasting
### [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com)
I first started podcasting with Gregg Pollack and the rest of the
Envy Labs & Code School team that rotates on the show. Recently I've 
become a regular co-host. With the help of serious audio engineering 
friends like Jamison Rabbe, Jason Madsen and John Friskics 

### [5 Minutes of JavaScript](http://five-js.envylabs.com/episodes/27-episode-27-may-15th-2014)
Recently Carlos Souza [invited me to co-host](http://five-js.envylabs.com/episodes/27-episode-27-may-15th-2014) this new Code School podcast 
which follows a similar format than Ruby5, but for JavaScript. It was so 
much fun I can't wait to be invited again.

### [A Hypothetical Movie Podcast](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/contributors/olivier)
I met Joshua Blount through co-workers and friends at Envy Labs and it 
was so great to finally be able to go full cinephile with a bunch of 
(sometimes) like-minded folks.

Along my [few contributions](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/contributors/olivier),
[our Django Unchained episode](http://www.hypotheticalpodcast.com/episode/django-unchained) remains my absolute favorite. Utter joy.

### [Parlons Ruby](http://parlonsruby.com/pr008-olivier-lacan/)
Two extremely nice French rubyists — [Fabien Catteau](https://github.com/fcat) 
and [Philippe Creux](https://twitter.com/pcreux) — approached me at the 
first [TakeOffConf](http://takeoffconf.com/2013) in Lille, France to do 
a little interview. It's all in French, but it was the first time someone asked
now how I got to where I was in early 2013, so it holds a chunk of 
nostalgia in my heart.

### [An Impolite Podcast](http://www.animpolitepodcast.com/episode/dolphinhorse)
Nice [conversation](http://www.animpolitepodcast.com/episode/dolphinhorse) 
with a devout friend about what it basically means to be an atheist.
