<h3>Coffee Shops</h3>

    <p>An honor-system community coffee shop and event space where you can meet 
    tons of creative people, enjoy good coffee, tea and pastries and great 
    music.</p>
    <p>The staff is incredibly friendly and can brew, steep, or conjure up 
    some good coffee, tea or hot chocolate for you.</p>
    <p>The back of the shop can be rented out for events during the day and the 
    whole shop can be rented out after 6PM every day.</p>

    <p>Hands down the best coffee shop in Orlando. The mood alone warrants a 
    visit: great quiet music, dim lighting, comfortable wooden chairs and 
    tables and a beautiful sense of clean design. The menu is a work of art and 
    hard work that can satisfy coffee and tea lovers.</p>

    <p>All the coffee is single origin; it can be brewed pour over style, or 
    using the lighter siphon method. There's plenty of great local snacks 
    and cookies to go with your drink and the small sandwhiches are perfect for 
    a light lunch.</p>

    <p>Make sure to try one of the single origin coffees. If you're an iced 
    coffee fan, give the cold brew a try. If you like sweet things in your 
    coffee I can't recommend the Dick Tracy (bacon &amp; melted sugar spoonful 
    served with a shot of espresso with black truffle chocolate, mapple syrup 
    and a jar of hot milk to mix it with), or the Butterscotch Latte (served 
    with some whipped cream in a mason jar). Tea lovers should give the selection 
    a sniff but try the Barrel Smoked Sweet Iced Team served in a closed mason 
    jar full of big ice cubes and smoke (yes, smoke) with a jar of sweet tea 
    and a cup of mapple syrup to dump in the mason jar — this thing is the best 
    mid-afternoon pickup ever if you prefer to go easy on the caffeine.</p>

    <p>In general, just explore the menu. The owner puts a lot of work into it 
    and it shows.</p>

    <p>According to my more knowledgeable coffee-afficionado friends, this is 
    hands down the best roaster in the area. They're currently located at the 
    back of East End Market which deserves its own section.</p>

<h3>Bakery &amp; Pastry Shops</h3>
<dl>

    <p>There are no better French pastries in Orlando. Accept no imitators. 
    Bear in mind, however, that great pastry chefs are not necessarily great 
    bakers. The Quiche Lorraine and Croque Madame are also great.</p>

    <p>My personal recommendation would be the lemon and apple Normandy tarts. 
    All the other wet pastries are safe bets even if the dry pastries (croissant, 
    pain au chocolat, etc.) are not the best.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="http://www.benjaminfrenchbakery.com/">Benjamin's</a></dt>
  <img src="http://distilleryimage5.s3.amazonaws.com/820b610241d911e3aec022000ae80f8c_8.jpg" alt="">
  <dd>
    <p>One of the things I missed the most from France (and Paris) was the 
    "Sandwich Parisien". A really basic ham and cheese sandwich on a fresh 
    half-baguette. Thanks to Benjamin's I can ease that craving whenever I want 
    now. They make the absolute best baguette in town and it's not a close call.</p>

    <p>They also have great quiches. While you can try any of them you should 
    start with the classic Quiche Lorraine (with bacon bits). The French family 
    that runs the show is from Bordeaux, and as you should expect they make 
    delicious local specialties called Canelé which you should try.</p>

    <p>If you're coming for lunch, just look over at the "Rustic Sandwiches" list 
    and pick a combination that you like, but I beg you, tell them not to toast 
    your sandwich. That's a nasty habit that I can only guess was brought about 
    by recent American habits and it ruins their great bread. Baguettes are not 
    rolls or subs, they come properly baked with an already "toasted" outter 
    shell — "la croute". If you toast a baguette sandwich after putting 
    ingredients inside you will surely warm those up, but you'll also turn the 
    bread into a overcooked brick. That might be acceptable when you're French 
    and used to chewing on tough bread but most Americans will (I speak from 
    experience, trust me) hurt their mouths. If it was up to me, I wouldn't 
    allow people to toast anything else than the inside of a baguette, and only 
    very lightly. </p>

    <p>This is something I've only discovered recently since they now have a home 
    base at the East End Market in Audubon Park. Their French Baguette is miles 
    better than what Publix passes as a baguette but I would rather recommend their 
    excellent "pains". In France, "pains" are larger round loafs of bread that 
    generally don't use white dough. Pain au Levain (Sourdough) is one of their 
    best. I also recommend their lovely Ciabatta rolls. Don't be afraid to explore, 
    I can't think of another local bakery with such a wide selection.</p>

<h3>Lunch &amp; Dinner</h3>

    <p>I'm extremely biased, but this is the best place for affordable, 
    creative, and healthy food in Orlando. All the dishes are a fusion of asian 
    and latin food. If that doesn't sound appealing to you, just picture this:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Thai Peanut Chicken Tako</li>
      <li>BBQ Pork Belly Tako</li>
      <li>Lamb Tako</li>
      <li>Cod Tako</li>
      <li>Indian Butter Chicken Burrito</li>
      <li>Thai Panang Chicken Burrito</li>
      <li>Spicy Beef and Plantain Banana Empenada</li>
      <li>Apple Ginger Empenada</li>
      <li>Tom Yum Chicken Arepa</li>
      <li>Pernil Pork Fun Bunz</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I can't summarize the quality and variety of the food there. Remember to 
    ask (or look) for specials. They change often and it's better for you to try 
    something new or ask the waiters for advice than stick to your guns. I made 
    that mistake early on and I regret it.</p>

    <p>One of the best features of Tako Cheena is that it's the best and cheapest 
    food place that is consistently open until 11PM from Tuesday to Sunday. 
    They're even open until 4AM on Friday and Saturday, but don't go there 
    wasted with numb tastebuds please, that would be a waste.</p>

    <p>If you're vegetarian or vegan, they always have friendly solutions that 
    are actually good, not just piss poor consolation prize. I don't like tofu 
    and their crispy tofu is the best I've ever had.</p>
