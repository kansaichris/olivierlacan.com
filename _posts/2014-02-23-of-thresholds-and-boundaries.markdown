In the US a few weeks ago the second of House of Cards was released on Netflix. Plenty of people in the part of the tech community I follow on Twitter and many of my friends have commented on the show — overwhelmingly in positive ways, with the occasional parody.

One piece of negative feedback I have heard repeatedly concerns the show's opening sequence: "too long, too damn long" say the people.

That's quite a few people, and I only searched in the last 24 hours. I wouldn't dare claim people's reaction to the length of these opening credits is newsworthy. It's not. Nobody cares what these people think.

But I do.

I do because people whining at opening credits make me want to go on a rant. And I'm nice enough to give you an out.

## Thresholds
The opening credits of a TV show serve a crucial purpose: they allow you — the viewer — to slowly leave your reality and be transposed to the fictional reality of the show. Great opening credits contain the essence of the show itself: its world, its characters, the themes, the era it takes place in.

Since a typical American TV show (on national networks) lasts about 42 minutes, there is precious little time to establish the setting and conventions of the show for potentially new viewers — or re-establish them for returning viewers.

As TV shows have become more complex and subtle over the last twenty years, opening sequences have followed suit. Re-establishing a complex universe with rich characters is a trickier affair than getting people ready to jump into the world of Hawaii Five-0.

## Binging or the Death of Restraint
The trouble with opening credits is that they were designed for a time when new episodes of TV show were a relatively rare event. It was common for shows to be delayed for one or several weeks or go on hiatus for a while. 

Now that it's much easier to decide what to watch and when, it's common for opening credits to stand in the way of instant gratification for viewers — especially on Netflix or any other (il)legal streaming service. If it's possible to watch 4 episodes of Game of Thrones in a row tonight, why wait for next week?

When it comes time to watch the second episode of the night, the purpose of the opening credits seems to have been diminished if not downright destroyed: you're in the mood, you're wrapped up in the universe of the show, let's get to it already.

So people whine about long credits that take their time bring you into their world

It's easy to see opening credits as mere mood setters; optional little things that can be skipped because you want to get to the thick of it, the real attraction.
