I just got into a Twitter fight with my pal [Joshua](http://log.joshuablount.com/post/62447279086/your-money-wont-save-everything). I absolutely love getting into arguments with good friends and generally with most reasonable people who have strong opinions.

Just before I flew to Portland, OR — in part to see Joshua (a treacherous Floridian escapee) and in part to attend the wonderful [XOXO festival](http://2013.xoxofest.com/) — I discovered the notion of [“strong opinions, weekly held”](http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/07/strong_opinions.html) and it really appealed to me.

I wouldn't call the chopped conversation I had with Joshua (another friend, [Josh Van Cleef](http://joshvc.com/), also participated) a fight. I would hesitate to call it a heated argument. I don't associate the same kind of emotional baggage with the word “argument” as most Americans seem to. I'm not trying to elevate myself above most Americans either. There is a lot of cultural baggage native Americans bring to words. Since I'm French, I simply don't. I didn't grow up here. 

To me an argument is something you craft, a piece of argumentation. It's a constructed point of view. Yes, it may clash against other people's arguments, and cause you to have a heated conversation, but ultimately there are good and bad arguments. Honest and dishonest points.

Here I will try to list Joshua's points:

1. money exchanged between parties does not guarantee anything beyond the immediate transaction, so implicit or explicit promises to support, or maintain a product or service are just that: promises.
2. it's always possible to escape any promise by refunding the transaction
3. the services many people pay for on the internet are not guarateed to survive and could disappear without a trace
4. when you use a service you relinquish control because you didn't do it yourself
5. it wouldn't too frustrating to replace Gravatar if it disappeared
6. if you depend on Gravatar exclusively for the survival of your company or product, it drastically alters the value proposition since you're dependent on people whose long-term vision you ignore

Alright. I actually don't disagree with many of Joshua's points. Provided I represented his main points correctly in the summarized list above, my main issue is with the first and the fifth.

To quickly touch on the idea that Gravatar wouldn't be too frustrating to replace, I think it would. Many services default their profile picture fetching to Gravatar because it's painless for them to implement, and because (until now) it's also painless for users to use across all their apps. Services that rely on Gravatar would all need to find a new third-party solution if Gravatar disappeared or they would need to build their own, disrupting their user's lives for the sake a profile picture. I think that's the very definition of frustrating.

Now about the first point. When I yell at people or companies that give products or services away for free, it's not necessarily because I think they're in fact selling me as the product to third parties. That said, this notion exists for a very good reason, and it is that one of the biggest companies in the world — Google — has based a very large portion of its income (I have no figure to support this) on doing just that.

It bothers me to see people forgo paid services or products. Maybe they started with a free offering, which allowed them to garner a lot of attention. The idea that a product or service would only be attractive when free seems nonsensical to me. 

If something solves a problem and I can vaguely quantify the time it saves me, then it's easy to have an idea of how much I would pay for it: an equivalent of how much I value the time this solution saves me. 

Many companies believe that asking people to pay for their products just won't work, that people won't find enough value in a paid tier or premium level of service, and that as a result, it won't be worth the effort.

They often base this notion on tenuous grounds. The proof is in the market, and they decide to stay out of it altogether. I worry that the people building these services have unintentionally rewired their brain against the very idea of becoming a profitable business. Somehow, they lost the ability to see that, yes, it is possible for a large group of people to find tangible value in something you produce.

Now to address the point more directly, I disagree with the idea that money does not guarantee anything beyond the immediate transaction. Money is a token for value. By exchanging value with another human being you send a message to them: "What you make has value, here's proof." The contract is implicit with products. I give you money in exchange for your product because I believe it is valuable or will bring me value in the future.

For services, it's a little different. You often pay for a service repeatedly. Maybe for a month or a year of service. “Here's my money upfront, now I trust that you will provide this service to me until I stop paying for it.”. Saying there is no guarantee in a transaction of this kind seems odd. It's up to the people involved in the transaction to decide what is guaranteed or isn't. [SLAs or Service-level agreements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-level_agreement) are a perfect example of such negotiated contractual terms.

Knowing there is no guaratee of support or maintenance *is* a contract. That's where I think Joshua fundamentally misses the point. Yes, Gravatar does not *really* refuse my money. They've just decided it wasn't worth their time to even try. Maybe for now, maybe forever. To me that means that as long as Gravatar makes sense for Automattic and WordPress, it will stay around. In the meantime no one will appear to be responsible for its maintenance, development or support. That's a problem because as with most services, Gravatar requires all of these. 

When it was run by the now co-founder and CEO of GitHub, Tom Preston-Werner, Gravatar did have [a premium tier](http://blog.gravatar.com/2007/02/16/welcome-to-gravatar-2-0/). GitHub in contrast, epitomizes what I wish more services that add value to the world would do: grow on free, survive on paid.

Otherwise, I find much to agree with Joshua on. 

It's foolish to rely too much on things you can't control. But to many technically savvy people's detriment, they often distrust the rest of the world to the point that they only rely on homemade tools. In companies, it's called the [Not Invented Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) syndrome. With individuals, it's almost a sort of [protectionism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism).

My ideal society is one within which expert toolmakers craft the best things and services they can possibly come up with, and trade them. For tools and services you don't know how to build or provide, or not as well as you'd like, you'd rely on other toolmakers and service providers. For such a system to function, there needs to be a value exchange system. Payment through currency or bartering, or even more interestingly, [voluntary donation](http://gittip.com/). 

I'm fine with there being free products and services when that benefits generous patrons, but I'd rather that be the exception rather than the rule. I find it easier to depend on transparent incentives than opaque ones.
