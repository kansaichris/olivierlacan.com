Why don't you start from scratch more often?
Why is it the impact of someone leaving your team so harsh on your team's productivity?
Why does it taste so bitter when someone jumps into your project and changes a lot of things?
Why do you always spend more time than you thought onboarding someone who recently joined you team? 

Information.

No matter how smart and passionate your co-workers are, information transfer will always have a limited bandwidth. When you join a team, depending on how humble and curious you are, your bandwidth for new information is at its peak.

You listen intently, you tread carefully, you ask as many questions as you can get away with before annoying your new teammates. You're also free of all the assumptions and biases that the team you joined has developed over time. Their habits may be justified, but if you're anything like me you're tolerance for inefficiency is at its minimum because you know that human beings have a tendency to become blind to tedious work if they have done it often enough.

You frustrate more easily than you ever will become there is no such thing as the status quo for you yet. Whether you have experience or not, you feel like a beginner (I hate the word junior, it's so fucking condescending). Unbeknownst to you, and your less thoughtful teammates, you're more useful to them than you will be for a while.

This is why it bothers me when I see job postings yammering about requiring 3 or 5+ years of experience or "senior" levels for every single position to be filled. Yes, there is a difference between someone with experience and someone with less experience. Experience has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks. Someone who grows into a team will often be far more invested than someone who's been around the block and knows they can keep going anytime.

It's often a game of incentives and perspective. With limited perspective and limited experience, the noise of other opportunities is reduced and the weight of past doesn't hinder inititiative. If what I'm describing sounds a lot like foolishness and insularity, that's because it is. You need weathered adventurers who've broken one too many ribs and you need overly enthusiastic sidekicks who can't wait to jump off cliffs.

Now the thing with information is that it's a prized possession for a eager sidekick. It's rare. You cherish it and you're so excited when you discover how something really works that you can't wait to share it with others. When your brain is filled with thousands of pieces of information about your team, its inner workings, how specific processes work and why something is designed in a counter-intuitive way, when you swim in information, it doesn't seem as valuable. But it is.

Every time someone asks you a question. You should give them the answer until you've written down in a place where everybody else can find it. If someone asks you the same question and there's not a place you can't point them to where the answer already lies, you have wasted your own time by hoarding information that is valuable to everybody.

When I joined Envy Labs over a year and a half ago, I was overwhelmed with information. I browsed through the source code of Code School and while I was excited as ever, my lack of knowledge about its inner workings was annoying. I had to ask. I had to interrupt. And I felt bad, because I know who difficult it is for creative people to get back to their flow when interrupted by a question.

Eventually though, the domain of my knowledge started expanding. Because I spent so much time doing support, user accounts were quickly demystified. We had a very simple administration system using [typus](https://github.com/fesplugas/typus). It was limited enough that [Adam](http://twitter.com/adamrensel) and I spent a lot of time on the console dealing with stuff in a more straightforward fashion. We used GitHub wikis to store information about specific things you couldn't easily figuring out by reading the code or the comments.

After searching users by email often enough I made a quick little TextExpander snippet that would take any email address in my clipboard and turn it into `User.find_by_email(email@example.com)`. That might seem silly, but I typed that stuff a lot.

We're a small team, so it's still rather rare for us to have to onboard a new developer for Code School development. It sounds a little crazy now, but I'm pretty sure that when Adam and I setup Code School on our own machines, it took us over a day. There were some instructions written in a wiki, but they were incomplete, slightly out of date, or OS X wasn't enjoying one of our dependencies.
