Here are a few important things people often forget when creating screencasts. Please try to remember them.

## Your voice is your voice
Voice is the medium of information in screencasts. You may think that what you do on the screen matters more but your voice is the guide, it needs to be clear and purposeful. If you sound like you're reciting what's written on a piece of paper, you will lose your audience's attention within seconds.

Be lively. If you're not excited about what you're screencasting about, give up now. Your wasting yours and everybody else's time.

### Microphone
You need a good microphone. No, your gaming headset will not cut it. That is not a microphone, it's a talkie walkie attached to your face. Do you often listen to educational content that sounds like a talkie walkie? Then wise up.

Your iPhone cord's microphone is also out of the question. So is your computer's embedded microphone. You are typing with your finders on that machine, which means the only thing your audience will hear is you pounding on their ears with your fat finger tips.

The best deal for screencasting beginners is the Yeti microphone. Yes, it's $100. That's what a pretty damn good microphone costs. A really good microphone costs triple that, but with a good microphone technique you can make the Yeti sound alright compared to most high quality studio microphones.

### Environment
Small rooms, with as little smooth surfaces to reflect sound as possible. Cloth is a pretty damn good sound dampening material. Hanging a bed sheet or something thicker like curtains behind you and in front of you can do wonders to the soundscape of your recording. Just like light, sound bounces around (that's why mountains answer when you scream at them). Account for that.

### Editing
If you're going to cut and paste section of your audio recording, and believe me you should, then you should first remember to record the ambiant noise that you microphone will pick up. This trick was given to me by Jon Friskics. He told me to record something like 10 seconds of ambiant noise, make sure it loops seamlessly and then use that as the baseline track for my screencast. This way, whenever I need to insert a silence between two audio clips, there is no longer a very noticeable dip into absolute silence. Absolute silence doesn't exist and it's extremely disturbing when you suddenly hear it. It's jarring.

Here's an example of three different clips of audio edited into a single track with and without baseline ambient noise. Good luck unhearing that from now on.

### Get in close, but not too close.
You can blow out the highlights in photography by overexposing your picture. The same is possible with audio if you're recording too loud. The audio sound wave will "clip", which means it will saturate at the absolute highest frequency it can support, and in the process you will piss off your listeners who need to adjust their volume down to save their ears.

Too many screencasters talk way too far from the sweet spot of a microphone, which prompts them to incrase gain. Gain in audio is the same as light sensitivity in photography and video. The higher the gain, the more crap the microphone will pick up:
- that stomach growl you have just before lunch
- that awkward swallowing sound you make when your throat gets dry
- that slight whistle from your allergic nose
- that slamming door in the office next door
- that bassy hum of trucks on the highway nearby

Imagine you're trying to whisper to the microphone as you would to a human being, that's how close you want to get. Yes, that's close. Won't that cause the audio level to be too high? No, not if you keep that gain down. You need to train yourself by looking at a sound level while recording. You should approach 0 decibels at the loudest points of your speech but never surpass it (otherwise sound will be clipped). Hovering between -10 and 0 is the best you can do. The sound wave you produce will be fuller and better defined, which means you'll sound much more natural to the human ear.
