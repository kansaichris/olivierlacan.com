It's 5:58 and I just finished watching [The Internet's Own Boy](http://www.takepart.com/internets-own-boy) 
by [Brian Knappenberger](https://twitter.com/knappB). I have some dried 
tears and some fresh ones running down my cheeks because the subject of 
this important movie — [Aaron Swartz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) — 
would have been proud today.

Today an ambitious campaign lead by [Lawrence Lessig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Lessig) 
called [Mayday](https://mayday.us) reached an incredible funding goal of 
five million US Dollars which will be matched by another five million US Dollars.

The goal of this fundraising is to create a "SuperPAC" to end all SuperPAC. 
A PAC is a [Political Action Committee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee)
which allows US candidates to elections to pool money in order to finance 
their campaigns. There is enormous abuse and corruption in campaign finance 
in the United States of America. This matters to the entire world because 
the entire world is virtually led by the United States of America — its 
last remaining super power, and the one nation with the greatest stranglehold 
on the Internet.

The entire unfortunate end of Aaron Swartz' life was dedicated to doing the most good 
he could possibly do. For him this meant allowing the public to access 
publicly funded research currently locked away in the proprietary grips 
of for-profit publishers who benefit handsomely from access tolls to 
invaluable public domain research. Swartz also played a huge role in 
deafeating the greatest threat to freedom of speech and the Internet ever 
— the so-called [SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act)
  US bill. 

Lawrence Lessig was a friend of Aaron Swartz's. He's featured in the movie 
The Internet's Own Boy quite a bit. It's humbling to think that despite 
Aaron having committed suicide a little over a year ago, Lessig has already 
been working so hard to uphold his legacy. And I'm sure many others have 
as well.

If you care about justice, freedom, and you believe the Internet is a 
tool for good, I urge you to [watch The Internet's Own Boy](http://www.takepart.com/internets-own-boy#watch). 

If you are an American Citizen or permanent resident, I kindly urge you 
to take a second and [donate to the Mayday campaign](https://mayday.us/).
