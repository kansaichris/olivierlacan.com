If you're technologically savvy, there's no doubt you've been watching the information being released about the myriad of NSA intelligence collection programs.

I don't think I'm qualified to comment on their extent, legality, or even if I know what to think of them.

However, I think you should watch this chilling presentation by Jacob Applebaum at the [Chaos Communication Congress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) in Hamburg, Germany today.

Yes, you should spend an hour watching this. But if you chose not to, let me boil it down for you: an American governmental agency mandated by the Congress of the United States of America has been systematically subverting and sabotaging security protocols designed and manufactured by foreign **and American companies**.

This means that instead of reporting and encouraging American companies to fix extremely serious security vulnerabilities that put US businesses and private individual at risk of corporate espionage or privacy invasion by anyone — terrorist groups, foreign governments, criminals, hackers, competitors — the NSA has been subverting these security vulnerabilities to further its own goal: communication [omniscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscience).

I believe in democracy, freedom of speech, and the privacy of all law-abiding citizen. The NSA doesn't, and nothing stands in their way.

The German newspaper *Der Spiegel* has more about these revelations in a multi-part piece titled [Inside TAO](http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-nsa-uses-powerful-toolbox-in-effort-to-spy-on-global-networks-a-940969-3.html).
