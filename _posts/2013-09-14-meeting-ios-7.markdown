## Setup Screen
- beautiful gentle fade to white
- rightbound bounce when you attempt to tap the screen instead of sliding your finger to the right
- "info" icon displays IMEI and ICCID information, probably useful for stores, questionably helpful (as an "info" section) for users
- the type treatment for "Hello" is absolutely gorgeous, doesn't seem too thin at all and I have very poor sight
- the "> slide to set up" type has slightly thicker strokes, and since it's smaller than the "Hello" one, is very legible as well

## Update Completed Screen
- I don't remember there being a screen confirming a successful update in earlier bersions of iOS 7, this is a nice addition if new.
- the fade to white while sliding right from the previous screen was very elegant, although it's a bit odd that the "Update Completed" copy came from the top (grows down to size as well)
- "Your iPhone was updated successfully. There are just a few more steps to follow, and then you're done.". Solid copy.

## Location Services Screen
- first appearance of the (dreaded) new "Back" but... arrow and link... more on this later
- Enabling or Disabling Location Services are offered as choices above the definition of "What is Location Services?". This doesn't make much sense, unless you assume that most users will know what Location Services are.
- "Enable" and "Disable" are offered as individual rows, with right-facing arrows at the end row seemingly suggesting more actions to be done to enable or disable. I don't remember that at all from previous versions of iOS. I feel like this choice used the traditional switch — which admittedly could have been confusing for users when it was transformed from "ON | OFF" to a skeumorphic switch with only colors as tell-tales.
- Good point: there's even a link to an "About Location Services" section that explains more precisely what Location Services are useful for and how they work (GPS + Wi-Fi)
- Even better (although verbose) within the "About Location Services" sub-section there is another link to "About Location Services and Privacy"
- Extremely oddly, the link to "About Location Services" is implemented as some kind of button (although no edges are visible) with a large tap area, and it's not underlined, which doesn't suggest that it's clickable and could confuse users into thinking it's just another heading. The *link* to "About Location Services and Privacy" is definitely not a button and its tap area is abysmally restrained, making it much harder to accurately trigger. I know it's a traditional link because when I long-tapped on it, the tap area was highlighted in grey and after a short while an "Open | Copy | Cancel" prompt was opened with the "applewebdata://" URL to the Privacy section.
- I wonder if that privacy is a link to allow Apple to update the Privacy copy without releasing a new version of iOS — it would make a lot of sense.

## Prompt when attempting to disable Location Services
- Apple checks whether you're sure you want to disable this since it will cause "Maps and other apps to use your approximate location", to copy also reminds you that you can turn Location Services back on, and where.

## Untitled Screen when enabling Location Services
- Surprised by the lack of consistency here, this interstitial screen has no title, although it was a "Back" link and a greyed-out "Next" link.
- the copy says "To finish setting up iCloud, enter the Apple ID password for **youremail@domain.com** (I replaced this since it's my personal email that was showing, surely because I updated from a previous version of iOS which was aware of it) but never bothers explaining what either iCloud or an Apple ID are, seems at odds with the nice explanations that came with the previous screens.
- this is the first appearance of the new iOS virtual keyboard and aside from the grey modifier keys (Shift, Backspace, 123, Globe, and Return), it looks great.
- options with "Forgot Password?" and "Skip This Step" are offered by a good chunk of screen real estate is wasted in explaining why I would skip or not skip this step
- the "Next" link becomes blue and bolded as soon as text is entered in the password field

## Short Updating iCloud Settings Screen
- Not much to report

## iMessage & FaceTime Screen
- no more "Back" link, I guess it's too late to change your mind
- suddenly, the explanations are back with "What are iMessage and Facetime?" at the bottom of the screen
- this is the screen that allows you to select what phone number and emails people can try to FaceTime and iMessage with you at
- I appreciate that the copy lets me know what will be my "caller ID" when using FaceTime, Messages and FaceTime Audio (oooh, that's new...) will be my phone number, but that I can change that in Settings later.
- to my bewilderment, what appeared to be a link or maybe a button to learn more about iMessage and FaceTime at the bottom of the screen was actually the heading of another paragraph beyond the initial viewport — that's pretty bad and inconsistent with every additional information offered until then, it's made worse by (mind-boggling) fact that no scroll bar appears when you tap the screen to attempt to click the apparent link/button. Instead you have to start swiping upward (to go down, which seems unlikely if you're unfamiliar with iOS conventions) to see a thin grey scrollbar appears

## Find My iPhone in iOS 7 Screen
- great way to introduce people to a new feature, especially since it relates to security, although I wonder if people with clean installs see this as well
- this informs you that your password will be required before anyone can turn off Find My iPhone, sign out of iCloud or erase and re-activate my iPhone — how did no one think of this when these features were originally released is a bit annoying — they're over two years old, and yes, I know that iteration is better than doing everything at once, but not when your major feature release cycle is a year

## Create a Passcode Screen
- oddly I don't remember Apple prompting you to create a passcode so forcefully before, I think it was simply an option in the settings — which makes me think that they're emphasis on the fact that only 50% of people used a Passcode on iOS was a bit silly, of course most people don't go hunting for additional and potentially tedious security features.
- there is still a link (the non-underlined button kind) for "Don't Add Passcode" which I appreciate since I find the feature futile and never let my phone out of my hands or pocket unless accidentally (Find My iPhone location or swipe are here for these situations, thankfully) and I'm extremely glad Fingerprint ID is coming to the iPhone 5C
- while typing these tirades I let my iPhone screen turn black and lock itself and when i unlocked the "Hello" screen appeared again, which frightened me into thinking the process had reset itself
- this accidental locking also allowed me to notice the atrocious copy of the French "Hello" message: "Faire Glisser Pour Continuer" (Make Slide to Continue), come on. 
- when you chose to not add a Passcode, Apple insists with a prompt that reminds you that "A passcode secures your iPhone". Good job.

## Welcome to iPhone
- I really dislike this weird Apple or English grammar oddity that makes them say "Welcome to iPhone" instead of "Welcome to your iPhone" or "Welcome to the iPhone", I can't stand the anthropomorphic lack of article.
- The "Get Started" link-or-maybe-button-who-knows already annoys me. I think the idea that people don't need to be tought touch interface conventions by using skeuomorphic cues (I didn't say design) is asinine and rushed. Apple — and everybody else — prided itself in the fact that babies could figure out how to operate an iPhone. Well you know what? A baby won't figure out that the blue-colored text is a button, you can put my money down on that. I think it's a huge loss for a negligable gain in simplicity or purity. It's a defeat of usability over aesthetics.

## Home Screen
- gorgeous granular downgrow animation of the home screen icons, I only worry that I will be shown this lovely animation every single time I unlock my phone — and I'm pretty sure that's the case
- great touch by letting people know with a prompt that "Spotlight Has Moved" and that you just have to swipe down from any home screen to access it — although know I wonder how the hell Spotlight fits in with Notification Center
- instead of vignetting the screen behind the prompt, as iOS beautifully did in previous versions, there is a slight dark overlay on the background behind the prompt — blurring would have been a nice touch considering the fancy new capabilities, but maybe this is reserved for the iPhone 5S and 5C
- the fluorescent lime green icon color used by Messages, FaceTime. Interesting that it's now a separate app, I'm having a hard time understanding Apple's strategy when it comes to splitting and merging features into apps.
- the Settings icon is extremely bland, it used to be one of my favorites but now it barely makes any sense, it's way too abstract and muddy.
- the grey gradient shared by Camera and Settings feels really out of place
- the Maps, Weather, Clock, Music, Mail, and Calendar icons are great
- let's not even talk about Calculator (use CalcBot), Reminders, or Contacts
- I *love* what they've done with folders. They were quite ugly for multiple iterations of iOS and now they finally don't feel like warts next to other icons, perhaps the scaling algorithm was improved for the icons, or maybe it's the increased size of icons in general that makes the tiny icons inside Folders much easier to see. On twitter Nathan Henderson mentioned that when opened, the folder display doesn't adjust to the height of the iPhone anymore and the icons are displayed in a 3 by 3 grid with pagination (like the home screen) — I think it's a minor drawback
- it's really nice that notifications at the top of the screen now have a small handle at the bottom, showing you how easily you can dismiss them, very much unlike the previous notifications.
- it is quite strange to not have anything to swipe two on the left side of the home screen, I think it's going to take some getting used to, I have to rewire a muscle memory I had developed. That said, I had never really enjoyed having spotlights on the right of the home screen, I accidentally accessed this screen far too often while swiping through home pages

## FaceTime app
- whoa it's freaky to see a blurred live image of myself behind the All Contacts first screen in that app, but I guess it's appropriate
- I think the problem is that it makes me feel like my phone can watch me, that's not a great feeling at all

## Lock Screen
- simply gorgeous, I've had a beautiful photo I took on a tiny road near my parent's house in Normandy in the summer of 2010 there for a long time and the new Lock screen showcases it much better than the old one did with its awkward rectangular semi-transparent gradients to black.
- I love the type treatment on the clock. Light, wide and extremely legible
- the type choice for the date below is excellent as well
- the paralax trick is an idiotic gimmick that will wear off very quickly
- I don't know how to call it (is it Notification Center?) but the screen you can swipe down from the top of the Lock screen is great, exactly the kind of information I want available at a glance without unlocking my phone
- oh my! the quick settings screen you can swipe up from the Lock screen is just as good as I expected it to be from photos and trying it out on friend's phones running the iOS 7 beta.
- beautiful detail: when you turn Do Not Disturb mode on and off from the quick Settings screen, the moon crescent icon grows and diminishes (through moon cycles!) — I don't remember such complex animations for menu bar icons before but it's delightful
- I just received Messages notification from my mom as I was typing this and it triggered a blurring and partially opaque dark obstruction of my lock screen picture, really nice touch
- I love that the fact you can "slide to reply" to a Lock screen Messages notification is spelled out in plain English instead of a vain attempt at a visual cue — and that it is only spelled out on the first message shown
- whenever you "slide to reply" to a message, the other ones are greyed out to confirm your action, great detail.

## Messages app
- that was probably the most iconic iPhone app design around, since it's often shown in movies and TV shows and will now date a 6-year epoch during which people texted on the iPhone with bubbly conversation balloons. 
- there seems to still be a bug when you upload a photo as it appears to go through the text input field before it moves on the conversation screen, it's a bit weird
- I'm not enchanted about the grey conversations displayed for the person you're messaging with
- oddly the context for which I had them put a nickname in previous version of iOS now are displayed with staring nickname instead of their name in the messages interface, since this isn't something I was aware of it was quite confusing when I try to find older text message by a person I had only texted with using their full name before

## Multi-task Screen
- what an upgrade, it's especially impressive that the thumbnails of currently running app are live for the current app — meaning if you're switching away from the Camera app, you can see the live photo preview even in the app switcher
- being able to swipe across screens *and* across icons is nice to, the icons allow for faster scrolling
- no need to tap and hold to remove a previously running app is nice, although it still allows people to believe they have to remove apps to save resources — which is an interesting myth born out of a poorly build user interface in previous iOS versions.

## Siri
- even though it's very common for people to say that Siri loses its usefulness quickly after you start discovering the many flaws and limitations, I've enjoyed the improvements over the first iteration last year. That said these improvement should have been there earlier and it seems like this iteration of Siri is the first one to come close to the potential that I expected Apple to reach two years ago
- one of the greatest points of frustration I had with Siri was that the Siri "chime" was much too long. The delay is frustrating when all you want to do is get to the point where you ask Siri to do something. Thankfully this issue is addressed in iOS 7. Now the Siri chime is much more brief, and the experience appears much more responsive because of that. 
- I also enjoy the voice feedback visualization on this version of Siri much better it's easier to see that it is listening to you. 
- I can't tell if this has been fixed yet but I truly hope that Apple has that with the issue that caused Siri never to remember that you prefer to use your phone as a sound input device whenever you wore connected via Bluetooth to some sort of hands-free car microphone. It turns out that these microphone is often have extremely poor quality and that your phone usually sits or is placed closer to your mouth and they are anyway unless you're using some sort of headphone system
- Siri's voice a lot more natural, the flow of her phrasing and pronunciation is incredibly smooth. It truly seems as if someone has pre-recorded what she says. From memory I'd say this is even better than what Google has achieved with Google Voice, but the issue is that it took Apple two years to iterate on Siri's voice quality, while Google has a shorter release cycle.
