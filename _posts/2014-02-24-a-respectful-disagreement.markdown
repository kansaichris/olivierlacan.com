I moved to Orlando, Florida about five years ago. I was 23-years old and I was an atheist. I also defined myself as a [scientific skeptic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_skepticism). Not a cynic, a skeptic. Someone whose default position regarding new information is doubt, someone who requires evidence in order to believe thing about the world and people.

When I moved here, in a portion of the United States that is vaguely considered the South (although there doesn't seem to be clear agreement there) I expected people to be far more religious than what I had been accustomed to in Paris, France. They were. More people were openly religious and those who were seemed more devout than the majority of religious people I had encountered in France in my life. Most strikingly, people were vocal about their religion in ways that would border on impoliteness in France. 

I don't rely think the French are imparted with secular enlightenment. It's just a much older country in which religious authority has been tied in with monarchy and serfdom for thousands of years. Some statistics like the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/fr.html) mention that 83 to 88% of religious people in France are catholic, 5 to 10% muslim, 2% protestant, and 1% jewish.
