For the last five years of my life I have been a non-immigrant, living the United States of America.

## How did I end up there?
I was extremely lucky to be raised by parents who were addicted to traveling. We went to Sicily and Greece when I was a little kid, to Ireland, Belgium, and Spain when I was young, and our longest adventures took us to Canada for many years in the summer.

It was pretty obvious then but it is all the more now that this was a privilege few other kids had. I got to see the world — not just the continent nearby — before I was even 11 years old. That had a huge impact on how I saw and thought about the world. And I'm pretty sure that it was a major factor in my early fascination with the Internet.

When my parents and I went to Canada, mostly to Québec (it's easier after all for French speakers and the place is beautiful), I think we all saw the place the more civilized version of North America. No crazy gun-totting Americans, no scary violence and more forests and lakes. The USA seemed like a scary place and my parents didn't really want to visit it, except maybe New York City. But we weren't really the city tourist kind.

Probably through much pressure on my part, my parents finally had cable TV and Internet installed in 2001. We had used dial-up previously since about 1997 or 1998 and we never had cable TV until that point — only Canal+, the French equivalent of HBO which was broadcast encrypted over the air. Along with my dad's knack for tinkering with computers and allowing me to join in and use his scraps to build my own machine, the arrival of broadband Internet is one of those things I can easily point to as a crucial moment in my life.

Suddenly, downloading MP3s didn't risk getting me in trouble anymore. I could even download video instead of vainly attempt to stream it with such atrocities as RealVideo and QuickTime. After trying to find interesting stuff on Napster, Scour Exchange
