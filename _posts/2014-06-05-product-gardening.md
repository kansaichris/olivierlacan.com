Recently, I announced that we were [hiring a software developer for Code School's 
internal team](https://www.codeschool.com/jobs):

The good Philip Arndt answered that:

It's a fair question since the meaning isn't self-evident. 
To me there are two basic circumstances in which you build software:

- the one where you build the software *you own*
- the one where you build the software *somebody else owns*

I think it's reasonable to call the first is "product work" and the 
second "client work". It's true that client work often still caters to 
an end-user that isn't directly *your* client, but with product work 
you are the owner. There is no interface between you and your end-user.

There's a certain appeal in the kind of freedom that product work affords. 
While you trade one client for thousands, it's much easier to say no to 
these thousands of clients, even if they're vocal. It imparts you with 
much more control over your priority.

I think of people who write software as tool builders. It follows 
in my mind that a tool builder should know how to construct a *better* 
tool. That doesn't mean the intended users of that tool are clueless 
about what exactly defines a good tool. It also doesn't mean that the user of the 
tool can't define constraints, requirements and suggestions to whoever 
builds it for them. Yet, what the user (or customer) pays the tool builder
for is their expertise in the crafting of reliable and useful tools.

Now, what do I mean by "product gardener"? Well, just like a tool maker, 
there is a specific set of variables a gardener has to account for when 
building and maintaining a garden. When planting something, they need to prepare the 
ground properly; use the right kind of soil; the right amount of watering. 
As time goes by, a gardener can't just sit, enjoy the fruits of their 
initial labor, and move on to something else. In order for their garden 
to thrive, they have to follow a discipline. They have to attend to what 
they've planted; every day, every week, every month, every year. 
If they don't, well, the product of their labor will disappear. And despite 
my allergies, I really like gardens, so that makes me sad.

I think this silly analogy helps to outline the tension here. 
If you're excited by initial struggles, but tend to find the long-term 
work of sustaining something to be tedious or unfulfilling, then there's 
a good chance you're not made to be a product gardener. Maybe you're an 
explorer, opening new paths for people who couldn't find or see them before. 
That doesn't make you less valuable. Michael Lopp would describe you as a 
["volatile"](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/stables-and-volatiles/), then
explain how crucial you can be to an organization's ability to innovate.

I once thought of myself as this kind of explorer. Somehow, I was able 
to crank out work from scratch in an afternoon, something I find very 
difficult to do today. Yet as the years passed by I kept stumbling on 
half-finished remnants of "good ideas" that had ignited fiery passion from
me for a few hours or a few days or a few weeks. But that fire burned too 
quickly, it exhausted all the fuel. I honestly thought I would never be 
able to commit to any project that would last more than three or six months.

Then something clicked. Maybe *I* changed. Somehow, though, I feel like 
I've always had this
[constant gardener](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constant_Gardener_(film)) 
seed inside of me. It was just unfulfilled for a long time because 
I hadn't yet found a discipline and an environment where it could blossom.

I think that environment was [Envy Labs](http://envylabs.com), and 
especially Code School. I found a place where I didn't have to waste energy 
convincing my peers of things that I felt should be normal. Instead I 
could focus on my work. Oddly the nature and specific function of my work 
within Code School has evolved very often over the course of two years. 
I spent quite some time on support, so I was in direct contact with our 
end-users and their needs.

I think getting lost in the forest of people who use the tools you build 
is a rejuvenating experience. At first it might seem noisy. It's easy to 
let yourself be swayed by the people that complain the loudest. 
But eventually a sort of music emerges. You stop hearing
the voices of individual people, instead you start sensing a breeze of 
discontent here, a buzzing of excitement there. In a very cheesy New Age 
kind of way, you start getting in touch with the nature of your users. 
A mix contexts, problems and potential solutions.

I could pursue this little metaphor yet further, but I think I've 
planted the seed of that idea firmly at this point. Now, concretely, 
what it means for us to be product gardeners is that we 
have to be careful not to lose ourselves by taking on too many tasks at 
once. Our main task is to sustain what has grown so far, and make sure 
people remain our priority. We have to accept that we can't be 
everywhere at the same time and that sometimes things must die so others 
can survive.

For example, in the past two years I've wanted to go on a rampage and 
build new features for [Code TV](https://www.codeschool.com/code_tv),
our repository of screencasts: to add @replies and better notifications, 
a full-text search feature, mark videos as watched only when people watch 
are done watching them, or provide subtitles and transcripts of all our episodes 
for people with disabilities or who don't speak English as a native language. 

There are many more things *I want* to do. But eventually I had to resign 
myself to the fact that, while I want them, I don't *need* to build them 
right now. Somebody else can, and certainly will. 

While talking with our team I often say that we should try to 
become the owners of whatever makes us lose sleep at night. While 
unfortunate, the absence of the features I listed above doesn't make me 
lose any sleep. But many more things do, and I have to make time for these.

If any of these thoughts made you sit up, shake your fist 
in the air and yell "YES! That!" at your screen while passers-by raised 
their eyebrows with concern at your rapidly declining sanity, 
then I beg you, send me an email, and come help us tend to 
[our little garden](https://www.codeschool.com).
